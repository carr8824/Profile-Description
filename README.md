# Cristhian Rodriguez-Revilla, PhD- Economics and Business


Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, you'll find my work related to my PhD research in economics and finance, and other independent projects in which I ve been working on. Most of my codes uses R and Python, for collecting, processing, and analyzing data. Recently Iven been involved in AI projects, involving NLP models, and coding in JavaScript, React, to support my knoledge in back-end. However, i have also enroled in front-end projects, requiring, CSS, and HTML. As you can see my Github has different language and structure based in the project and the languages required to implment them. My Github is not organized as well as code for replicating popular published papers and exploratory data analysis.
