# Cristhian Rodriguez-Revilla, PhD - Economics and Business

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Cristhian, an accomplished finance researcher poised to complete my Ph.D. by the summer of 2024. My research spans asset management, pricing, and portfolio performance, with a focus on the impact of organizational structures and the predictability of fixed-income asset pricing models.

With expertise in data science, predictive models, asset pricing, and financial derivatives, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor and technical skills. I'm committed to personal and professional growth, and I strive to provide insightful solutions in the fields of finance and economics.

Here, you'll find a range of projects from my PhD research and other independent endeavors. My work primarily involves R and Python for data collection, processing, and analysis. I've also ventured into AI, including NLP models and JavaScript/React projects, along with front-end development using CSS and HTML.

Feel free to explore my diverse projects, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at [carr8824@gmail.com](mailto:carr8824@gmail.com).
